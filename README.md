## Project Description
  This project is to practice Object Oriented Javascript. The website is an ice-cream shop where you can pick flavor, size, cone and toppings to find the price. You can also create an order of several ice creams. 
## Specs
 
```
Describe: IceCream()
Test: "It will take four arguments and create Icecream instances with properties: flavor, size, cone, and toppings"
Expect(let iceCream = new IceCream(flavors, size, cone, toppings)).toEqual({flavors: [flavors], size: size, cone: cone, toppings: [toppings]});

Describe: IceCream.prototype.price()
Test: "It will use branching logic to evaluate the properties of IceCream and determine the price"
Expect(iceCream.price).toEqual({flavors: [flavors], size: size, cone: cone, toppings: [toppings], price: 7.50})
